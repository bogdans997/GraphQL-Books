## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to build a GraphQL API using Spring Boot that manages a library of books, authors, and reviews.
It showcases how GraphQL can solve common REST API challenges like overfetching, underfetching, and multiple endpoint calls
while providing a flexible and efficient way to query data.

## Why GraphQL

* No more over-fetching
* Multiple Request for multiple resources
* Avoid REST API Explosion of endpoints
* Strongly-typed Schema
* Self Documenting
* Developer Tooling
* Avoids API Versioning
